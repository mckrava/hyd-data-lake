# üåä Liquidity Pools Indexer

An indexer for the **Hydration mainnet** and **Pareo testnet**, designed to collect and organize data on liquidity pools across chains.

---

## üìä Blockchain Storage Datasource

The Liquidity Pools Indexer is implemented with the flexibility to use multiple sources of blockchain data. These data sources are prioritized in a fallback sequence to ensure robust data retrieval:

1. **Storage Dictionary** (primary source for prefetched data)
2. **Runtime API Calls** (specific data on-demand)
3. **RPC Calls to Storage** (fallback for all other methods)

The **StorageResolver** orchestrates this process by attempting to fetch the required data in the order listed above. If a primary source is unavailable or incomplete, the resolver falls back to the next source.

### üîß Optimizing with Storage Dictionary

To maximize efficiency when using the **Storage Dictionary**, the indexer performs the following steps during the batch processing flow:
1. **Parse Events and Calls**: Identifies all required data at the start of the batch.
2. **Collect Keys**: Gathers the necessary keys for subsequent processing.
3. **Fetch Data**: Queries the Storage Dictionary for:
  - Specific keys at specific blocks.
  - All keys within a block range, avoiding heavy filtering in API queries (fetching redundant data is acceptable to improve reliability).
4. **Process Batch**: Utilizes the prefetched data during the batch processing logic.

This design minimizes latency, improves reliability, and reduces RPC payload.

## üåê Hydration and Paseo Chains

The Liquidity Pools Indexer supports both the **Hydration mainnet** and the **Hydration Paseo testnet** with the same codebase.

### üîÑ Switching Between Chains
Use the `CHAIN` runtime environment variable to specify the target chain:
```bash
CHAIN: "hydration" | "hydration_paseo"
```

### üõ† Chain-Specific Details

- **Hydration Mainnet**:  
  Utilizes the Storage Dictionary to optimize data retrieval for events, calls, and storage.

- **Hydration Paseo Testnet**:  
  Does not support the Storage Dictionary. All storage data is fetched directly from the RPC node, relying on Runtime API and RPC calls for data retrieval.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
While the same event handlers are used across both chains, chain-specific events, calls, and storage parsers are generated separately to ensure compatibility.

### Currently tracking for following entities are implemented:

- assets *(all assets based on AssetsRegistry pallet and Registered/Updated events)*

- lbp pool entities *(with actual assets balances)*
- lbp pool historical volumes *(per block where buy/sell activity is existing)*
- lbp pool historical prices *(asset balances per each block)*
- lbp pool operations *(swaps)*


- xyk pool entities *(with actual assets balances)*
- xyk pool historical volumes *(per block where buy/sell activity is existing)*
- xyk pool historical prices *(asset balances per each block)*
- xyk pool operations *(swaps)*


- omnipool entity
- omnipool assets *(each asset separately)*
- omnipool asset historical volumes *(per block where buy/sell activity is existing)*
- omnipool operations *(swaps)*


- stablepool entities
- stablepool assets *(each asset separately)*
- stablepool asset historical volumes *(per block where buy/sell/liquidity_added/liquidity_removed activity is existing)*
- stablepool operations *(swaps)*
- stablepool liquidity actions *(required for correct volume aggregation in case omnipool triggers remove_liquidity from stablepool as part of it's sell/buy order fullfilment)*
- stablepool asset liquidity historical amount

### API augments:

- query `xykPoolHistoricalVolumesByPeriod`get aggregated volumes for requested list of xyk pools by requested block range
- query `omnipoolAssetHistoricalVolumesByPeriod`get aggregated volumes for requested list of omnipool assets by requested block range
- query `stablepoolHistoricalVolumesByPeriod`get aggregated volumes for requested list of xyk pools by requested block range


- subscription `xykPoolHistoricalVolume(filter: {poolIds: [String]})` - events on each new record of `xykPoolHistoricalVolume`
- subscription `omnipoolAssetHistoricalVolume(filter: {omnipoolAssetIds: [String]})` - events on each new record of `omnipoolAssetHistoricalVolume`
- subscription `stablepoolHistoricalVolume(filter: {poolIds: [String]})` - events on each new record of `stablepoolHistoricalVolume`

### Important notices:

- `lbpPoolHistoricalPrice` and `xykPoolHistoricalPrice` are tracking only after indexer reached head of archive == on reindexing phase prices are not processing because it requires heavy storage calls
- `stablepoolAssetHistoricalVolume` contains `routedLiqRemovedAmount` value - it's amount of removed liquidity from stablepool, which is matched with omnipool sell/buy event within the same block. So this amount can be added to Sell/Buy volume of stablepool. **Match rules:**
  - `Omnipool.Buy/SellExecuted.asset_out == Stableswap.LiquidityRemoved.pool_id`
  - `Omnipool.Buy/SellExecuted.amount_out == Stableswap.LiquidityRemoved.shares`
- all API subscriptions have filter so UI can subscribe to updates of specific list of entities by ID
